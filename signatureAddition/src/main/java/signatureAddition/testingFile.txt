I have been blessed that I got Niranjan Agrawal as my brother in my life. He is not just brother, he is my Father. He always stands with me in my tough time. I cannot find a single moment in which I am stuck at the obstucle and he was not there with me. Thank you Sai Baba, for such a beautifiul gift that you have given to me.
